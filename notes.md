Need to save playlist info to db so that the user can see whether he is following playlist already


create a rails api layer for festival info

add tags to playlists
ajax the follow button
maybe add a description to the playlists (looks better on index)
search/filter by tags on index

generate playlist by just logging in !!!

Why does the logout flash message stay on the page?

favicon

once i pull in follows, write a method to rank playlists to display on playlists#index
